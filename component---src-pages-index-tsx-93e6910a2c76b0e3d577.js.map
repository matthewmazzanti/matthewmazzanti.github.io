I brought the scattered pieces into a single\n        monorepo, created a cutting edge build and deployment system, and\n        worked tirelessly to iterate and improve upon the system. Over the\n        course of two months, the product went from a proof of concept to a\n        real deployed system, used every day by physicians in Maryland.\n\n        Hightlights:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <b>AWS containerized services</b> - Shifted from an unrefined,\n          ad-hoc EC2 deployment system to a stable and highly available\n          container based system hosted in ECS.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <b>Devops/Continuous integration</b> - Completely retooled the\n          build system to facilitate auto triggered reproducable builds and\n          deployments using AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <b>UI/UX design</b> - Built and maintained multiple websites\n          with both Angular and React frontends, rebuilding and\n          rearchitecting the systems so that they became more reliable,\n          faster, and easier to use.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <b>Tight timelines</b> - As an early-stage startup, all of the\n          work was done under incredibly tight timelines, with little\n          tolerance for downtime. A major focus of the design and\n          deployment was ensuring that everything was done in a way to\n          maximize output and results, while being quick to bugfix and\n          redeploy if problems arose.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <b>Reverse engineering</b> - Left with little documentation, I had\n          to reverse engineer thousands of lines of code in order to improve\n          and extend services.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3>AT&T Chief Security Office</h3>\n      <p>\n        <h4>Jun 2019 to Feb 2020</h4>\n        Focused on command-line data manipulation tools, I brought my\n        knowledge of compter science and UX design to make manipulating data\n        easy and simple for security researchers at AT&T.
